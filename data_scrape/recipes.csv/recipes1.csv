Gulab Jamun,50mins,177.44 powdered milk; 88.72 all-purpose flour; 1.84 baking soda; 22.18 butter; milk; 354.88 sugar; 177.44 water; 3-4 cardamom pods; 2-4 saffron threads; oil (for frying),"Make the dough by combining the milk powder, flour, butter. Add just enough whole milk to make a medium-hard dough. Divide the dough into 18-20 portions. Make balls by gently rolling each portion between your palms into a smooth ball. Place the balls on a plate. Cover with a damp yet dry kitchen towel. Heat the oil on high and then lower the heat to medium. Slip in the balls into the hot oil from the side of the pan, one by one. They will sink to the bottom of the pan, but do not try to move them. Instead, gently shake the pan to keep the balls from browning on just one side. After about 5 mins, the balls will rise to the surface. The Gulab Jamuns should rise slowly to the top if the temperature is just right. Now they must be gently and constantly agitated to ensure even browning on all sides. If the temperature of the oil is too high then the gulab jamuns will tend to break. So adjust the temperature to ensure that the gulab jamuns do not break or cook too quickly. The balls must be fried very slowly under medium temperatures. This will ensure complete cooking from inside and even browning. The syrup should be made earlier and kept warm. To make the hot sugar syrup add mix the 2 cups of sugar to 1 cup of water. Add 4-5 cardamom pods, slightly crushed and a few strands of Kesar (Saffron). Mix with a spoon and then heat at medium heat for 5-10 minutes until sugar is all dissolved in water. Do not overheat, that will caramelize the sugar. Transfer this hot syrup into a serving dish. Keep warm on stove. Add the fried gulab jamuns directly into the warm syrup. Leave gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup overnight for best results. They can be served warm or at room temperature."
Mango Mint Chutney,1hr 15mins,22.18 extra virgin olive oil; 1 yellow onion; 0.18 ml    red chili pepper flakes; 7.39 ginger; 680.38 mangoes; 7.39 curry powder; 22.18 honey; 22.18 white wine vinegar; 177.44 water; lemon; 59.08 mint,"To make the chutney, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil a medium sauce pan over medium heat.

Puran Poli,1hr,"266.16 whole wheat flour; 133.08 water; 0.46 salt; 0.92 ml    oil; 11.09-27.73 ghee; 11.09 ghee; 44.36 ml   split pigeon peas, cooked in 1 cup water until softened; 44.36 sugar; 1-2 green cardamom pods; 1-1 saffron strands; 0.46 nutmeg","Method: Filling. Warm two tablespoons of ghee in a nonstick saucepan. As it melts, add the cooked pigeon peas, and stir until the water evaporates and the mixture thickens. Continually scrape the sides of the saucepan to ensure even distribution of heat or else the daal will burn. Add half the sugar and stir it in well. Adjust to desired sweetness. Reduce the heat and continue to thicken until the mashed pigeon peas resemble mashed potatoes. Add the crushed cardamom powder, saffron and nutmeg, stir well and portion into eight pieces. This filling can be made up to 3 days in advance, and stored in the fridge until ready to use. Bring it to room temperature to ease the rolling process. Method: Dough. Using a food processor fitted with an S blade or in a large bowl, combine the flour with salt and enough water to make a firm dough. The dough should be firm but not hard, moist but not wet, and similar in consistency of modeling clay. Carefully knead the oil into the dough and cover with a clear wrap or lid until ready to roll. Method: Rolling & Cooking. Start by rolling out a single ball of dough into a flat disk, as one would begin a paratha, no more than 5” diameter. Place the mashed sweetened pigeon peas mash, puran, in the center, pinch the dough and fold over the ball to cover the ball completely, like a dumpling. Ensure the seams are sealed. Lightly flatten this in the palm of your hand. Dredge the ball in dry flour and begin to roll again, this time very lightly to ensure the filling does not spill out. Roll to make an 8” poli using dry flour to dust as needed. When sufficiently rolled, dust off excess flour. Heat a shallow nonstick pan on medium-high heat. When ready to place a Puran poli in the pan, turn it down to medium heat. The side that hits the pan first is the first side. Watch the dough bubble slightly and move it around in the pan without flipping it over. Turn the Puran poli over approximately 1 minute later. The first side should be lightly spotted but not have dark spots. If this happens too quickly, reduce the heat. Repeat on the second side, and while the second side cooks, lightly baste the first side of the with ghee. Using a spatula, flip the paratha and repeat the basting. Both sides should have ghee—cooked once without ghee and once with ghee. Remove from heat and cover with a paper towel or a colander to help the steam evaporate. Once they have come to room temperature, the Puran Poli can be transferred to an appropriate storage container."

Add chicken pieces and marinate for 25-30 minutes. Dry-roast coriander seeds in frying pan over a medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add cumin seeds and dry-roast for 30 seconds. Grind these spices in blender, or mortar & pestle, then mix them in non-metallic bowl with other ingredients for second marinade. Salt to taste, and add chicken pieces. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto metal or pre-soaked wooden skewers. Pre-heat a grill, chargrill or grill pan to hot. Grill the skewered chicken, turning a few times, so that the chicken gets cooked evenly from all sides. Remove the chicken from the grill. Take the pieces off the skewers and place on a plate. For tomato masala heat ghee, or oil in frying pan. When the ghee is ready, turn the heat to medium-high and fry coriander seeds and cinnamon stick for 1 minute. Add bay leaves, cloves, green cardamoms and black peppercorns, and fry for 1 more minute. Now add halfed tomatoes and stir for 2-3 minutes. Add 125 ml of hot water, bring to the boil, reduce the heat to medium, and cover with a lid. After 20 minutes remove skin from the tomatoes and continue to simmer until the tomatoes have completely disintegrated. Now remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaves from tomato masala and blend it with a hand-held blender and pass it through a sieve to obtain smooth puree. Set this masala aside. For the gravy heat the ghee in frying pan. When the ghee is hot, add the onions and reduce the heat to medium. Fry for 10-15 minutes, or until onions are tender and golden. In the meantime, put almonds and desiccated coconut in blender and grind to powder. Now grind this almond-coconut powder with double cream and a little water to make a fine paste. When the onions are golden add garlic, ginger, and green chillies, and fry for 1 minute. Then add turmeric, paprika  and cumin and saute for 30 seconds. Put in the tomato masala, almond-coconut paste, tomato paste, honey and 125 ml of hot water. Cook for 10 minutes, or until sauce starts to thicken. Remove the curry sauce from the heat, and blend it again with the hand-held blender until smooth. Return to a clean pan, reheat again and add cheddar cheese. When the cheese is melted, slowly whisk in the cream. Add dry fenugreek leaves, garam masala and salt to taste. Put in the chicken pieces and stir for 3-4 minutes over medium heat. To finish the dish, stir in the chopped coriander leaves. Serve with naan bread or pilau rice."
Naan,40mins,283.90 flour; 1.47 baking powder; 1.47 salt; 141.95 plain low-fat yogurt,"Mix together flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in the yogurt till the dough is too stiff for a spoon, then knead it in the bowl till it holds together well, adding more flour if necessary. Turn it out on a floured surface and continue kneading for about 5 minutes till the dough feels smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball and put it in an oiled bowl, covered with a towel, to rest for an hour or longer. Take the dough out and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Form each into a ball and press the balls flat into round discs. Heat a large frying pan or griddle, either seasoned cast iron or a good non-stick finish. Heat your oven to about 500 and have the broiler on (this is how the original recipe states it - I know with my oven it's either 500 degree oven OR the broiler, but you get the idea. Take 1 piece of dough at a time and roll it out on a floured surface till it is about 8-10 inches across and less than 1/4 inch thick. Lay it on the hot griddle and cook it over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes (I don't think mine took that long). It will puff up in places or all over, and there will be some blackish-brown spots on the bottom. Slide a spatula under the naan and transfer it to the oven, directly onto the rack, for a minute or two, just till it finishes puffing up into a balloon and begins to color lightly on top. Remove naan from the oven and brush it lightly with melted butter if you like. Continue this way with all the dough, stacking the breads into a napkin-lined basket. Serve the breads hot, fresh from the oven, or let them cool and wrap them up. To reheat, wrap them in aluminum foil, in packets of 4 or 5 breads and put them in a 400 degree oven for 10-15 minutes."

Homemade Jalebis,45mins,39.43 all-purpose flour; 1.64 gram flour; 19.71 plain yogurt; 19.71 water; 0.04 baking soda; 83 ghee; 83 ml    sugar syrup,"Put flour in a mixing bowl. Add gramflour. Mix well. Add yogurt and water. Mix well, using a spoon, ensuring that no lumps remain. Mix to obtain what is technically called,""ribbon consistency"". (Ribbon consistency simply requires you to mix for about 5-7 minutes, really well, so that when the mixture is dropped from the mixing spoon into the mixing bowl, it should fall like a ribbon. Don't let the term scare you, it's pretty easy, you just got to). Add a pinch of baking soda. At this point, this mixture (batter) can be refrigerated if you are planning on making the jalebis later. If you plan to make the jalebis instantly, put the mixture in a jalebi bottle (you get these bottles to make jalebis in the market). If you dont have a jalebi bottle, you can use an empty well-washed and thoroughly clean, tomato ketchup bottle. If you got an icing bag, use that. I used the icing bag with the""star"" nozzle attachment. You may experiment with the other nozzles, if you wish, but please dont, in any circumstances, try using the""writing"" nozzle attachment, because if you do so, the jalebis that you'll be making will be the thinnest on the face of the planet,lol. Heat oil on low-medium flame in a frying pan. Meanwhile, spoon the above prepared batter in the icing bag fitted with the star nozzle/jalebi bottle/ tomato ketchup bottle. Drop the batter by squeezing the bottle/icing bag, into the hot oil, in concentric circular motion to make the jalebis. Lightly brown on either side. Repeat until all the batter is used up. On low flame heat the pre-prepared sugar-water syrup (known in Hindi as""chashni""). Add few threads of saffron to the syrup- these look really pretty on the jalebis later when you dip the latter into them. Now, drain the excess oil from the jalebis. Drop into the sugar-water syrup. Dip well, toss well, to coat the jalebis in the syrup. Drain excess syrup from the jalebis. Serve immediately or serve hot if you plan to serve them later on, make sure to warm them a bit in the oven (2-3 minutes) and then serve. Get ready to put on your apron and go make more of these because they'll vanish before you know! Don't blame ME if you get addicted to these like my DAD."
Kulfi,12hrs,"148.83 fat-free evaporated milk; 88.72 ml    light cream (I used half and half here); 148.83 low fat  sweetened condensed milk; 0 to taste   other flavoring (I sprinkled in some cinnamon, but I would imagine that chocolate or something else would work here.)","In a large bowl, stir together well the evaporated milk, condensed milk, cream, and optional other flavor.

Restaurant-Style Tandoori Chicken,1hr 10mins,"59.14 plain yogurt; 3.69 lemon juice; 1.23 allspice; 1.23 fresh coarse ground black pepper; 1.23 ground cayenne pepper; 1.23 ground cinnamon; 2.46 ground cumin; 1.23 ground ginger; 2.46 salt; 1.23 ml    smoked paprika; 3.69 garlic; 3.69 ml   thai chili paste with garlic (optional, but recommended!); 3 chicken; 1 onions; 0 lemon","In a small mixing bowl, stir together the yogurt and lemon juice.  Add the spices, minced garlic, and chili paste, and whisk until you have a smooth, thick marinade. Put 6 pieces of the chicken in each of two zip-lock bags, and add 1/2 the marinade to each bag.  Zip closed and knead the bags until the chicken is well-coated with marinade.  Open bags slightly, squeeze out most of the air, and zip closed again.  Refrigerate 12-24 hours.  If serving this for dinner, I usually make the marinade and start the chicken soaking the evening before. Turn the bags and knead the marinating chicken once or twice while it's in the refrigerator. When you are ready to cook, take the chicken out of the refrigerator, line a large roasting pan with foil, lay a rack over the pan so air can circulate under the roasting chicken, and pre-heat your oven to 425.  If you have a convection bake or convection roast cycle, use that. Place the chicken pieces on the rack so they are not touching.  Empty what is left of the marinade into a bowl or measuring cup and touch up any ""empty"" spots on the chicken pieces with the marinade. Once the oven is hot, put the pan with the chicken in the oven, and leave the door closed (no peeking!).  Turn the chicken pieces once after 30 minutes of cooking time, then roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly charred on the second side, but no more than 15 minutes for legs and thighs.  If you are cooking breasts, poke one with a skewer to make sure the juices run clear. NOW TURN THE OVEN OFF, and let the chicken rest in the closed oven for 20-30 minutes more (not critical, but NO PEEKING!). Remove the chicken to a warm platter, garnish with the onion rings and a few squeezes of lemon, and enjoy! See if you don't agree this is as good as any ""authentic"" Tandoori chicken you've ever tried!"

To begin, measure out 1 part tapioca to 8 parts water and add to a large pot. Bring to a boil. Once at a boil, reduce to a simmer, and stir pot. Make sure to stir at least once every 10 minutes, for about 60 minutes. Don't be afraid to add extra water if the water levels are looking low.

When the tapioca pearls are cooled down, pack in water and store until eating. The next day, or whenever ready to eat falood, take out the tapioca, add rosewater, and stir inches  I added about 1 tablespoon for about 6 cups of tapioca pearls. IF you do not like floral tastes, add less. To assemble the falooda: add a tablespoon or two of jam to each glass of falooda. Next, add the tapioca pearls, then add vanilla ice cream to the top. if using strawberries and whipped cream, you can add these to the top. You can also do layers of each of the components. Enjoy!

When kneading, make your hand into a fist and roll your knuckles into the dough, folding edges in continuously, working in all the flour. When all the flour is kneaded into a ball, poke lots of holes into the ball of dough. Pour a little oil into the dough and knead it inches. Add the rest of the oil (the dough will look very oily and that's the way it should be). Cover with a clean cloth and let sit for at least an hour. Roll the ball in a little bit of flour so it's not sticky. Divide the dough into about 15-20 balls depending on how big you want the chappatis to be. Flour the counter/board. Roll out each ball to about 6 inches in diameter. Brush with melted butter. Fold in three (like you fold a letter). Now it should almost look like a long tube. Take one end of that tube and fold it in to the centre and gently press it inches. Take the other end of the tube and fold it over the seam. Now you should have a little bundle of dough.

Brush with melted butter, shuffling it around the pan quickly, then a quick flip over, a bit of melted butter (it should start puffing up into a pillow like shape). Once it has small golden brown dots on both sides, take it off an put into a serving dish (cover with a clean cloth as you keep preparing the rest). You will have to adjust the heat during the whole frying process. Clean off the pan with paper towels or a clean cloth in between frying each chappati.

Chicken Curry,1hr 10mins,2 onions; 4 garlic cloves; 1 ginger; 6 chicken drumsticks; 6 chicken thighs; 4 cloves; 2-3 cardamom; 2 cinnamon bark; 1 tomatoes; 2 chili powder; 1 turmeric; 1 cumin; 16.63 salt; 4-5 chilies,"1) Peel and cut up onions into 6-8 pieces each (something that will fit into a food processor or a blender). Peel garlic and ginger. 2)Put onions, garlic, and ginger into food processor or blender with a spoon of water. Blend/grate into a rough paste. Does not need to be super smooth. 3) Prep the chicken - take skins off if you bought chicken with the skin on. Rinse the chicken with water and pat dry. Create slits in the pieces randomly with a knife so that the spices can get into the meat. 4) Take about 4 spoons of the onion, garlic, ginger paste and the spices (Indian chili powder, turmeric, cumin) and coat the chicken with it all.  Add the salt as well. NOTE RE SPICES: we never measure these spices, but ratios help. For this part of the recipe, smaller amounts of each chili powder, cumin, and turmeric are fine - let's say one spoon of each, more of the chili powder if you want it spicy. 5) Place a 6-8 quart pot on medium-high heat. Add a turn or two of canola oil, enough to evenly coat the bottom of the pot. When the oil is heated through, add cloves, cardamom (try to open them up a bit), and cinnamon bark. Stir the whole spices around a little until fragrant. 6) Once you start smelling the whole spices, add the rest of your onion/garlic/ginger paste. Cook until the paste starts to take on a slightly reddish color. Add larger amounts of the spices now. I will do two generous shakes of the chili powder (I like my curries spicy), one shake of ground cumin, and one shake of turmeric. If it looks too brown, I will add some turmeric and chili powder because I want it to be a little brighter. 7) Add the chicken after the paste and spices incorporate. Stir frequently so the chicken does not stick to the pot. Once all the chicken turns opaque on the outside, cover with a lid, lower the heat to medium and let everything cook together for about 20 minutes. 8) After 20 minutes, check the pot to see if any liquid has come out. This is the curry! If it looks dry, add some a couple cups of hot water to the pot, but only if it looks totally dry. Stir the chicken and recover the pot, lower the heat a little more, and let it all simmer/stew together for another 20 minutes. 9) 15 minutes into the second 20 minutes, add the Thai chilies. Make sure they are washed. If you want more of the heat to come out of the chilies, make one diagonal slit in each chili. Adding the chilies is optional. 10) At the end of the 20 minutes, check your pot. There should be ample curry. Give it all a final stir and check the chicken to make sure it is all cooked through. It should be by now, but you can never be too careful! Have some cooked rice handy and serve with some saag bhaji (another recipe!). This recipe is easy to scale up or down and if you have leftovers, you can eat this up to 4 days after you make it, at least."

Papadams,55mins,"118.29 gram flour; 1.23 black pepper; 1.23 ground cumin; 0.61 salt; 0 garlic; 14.78 water; 3.69 water; 0 cayenne; 0 to taste    oil, for frying  (optional)","Stir together the flour, pepper, ground cumin seed, and salt in a large bowl or in the food processor; mix thoroughly until the spices are evenly distributed. Add the garlic and mix well. Add enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball; if necessary, add up to 1 additional tablespoon water. The dough should be fairly stiff and dry; if it is too wet, it will not roll well. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes by hand or pulse for about 15 seconds in the food processor; the dough should be smooth. With your hands, shape the dough into a cylinder or log about 2 inches thick and 6 inches long. With a sharp knife, cut the cylinder into 1/2-inch thick slices. The next step uses oil, so do not use your pastry cloth and rolling pin sleeve. Place each slice on a lightly oiled surface. Lightly oil the top of the slice and then roll out into a very thin circle about 6 or 7 inches in diameter. Papadams must be rolled extremely thin, maximum 1/16 inch. If the dough sticks to your rolling pin, gently pull it off. Dust the tops of each papadam with cayenne pepper. Using a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the papadams from the rolling surface, carefully place them on large baking sheets. The traditional method for preparing and frying papadams is described below; you can also bake them in a 300F oven for about 15 to 25 minutes, or until crisp and dry. The cooking time may vary beyond this range depending upon the thickness and moisture in the rolled dough. Cool them on a rack. To prepare the papadams in an authentic manner, don't bake them; first allow them to dry by leaving them in the sun for a few hours or by placing them in a very low oven (less than 200F) for 1 to 2 hours, turning occasionally. Dry the papadams until they are just slightly flexible and show no moisture; they should not brown or bake, however. At this point, the papadams may be stacked flat and stored in an airtight container until needed; they will keep for months if stored properly. When ready to serve, heat about 1/8 inch of oil in a large skillet; the oil should be hot, but not smoking; a drop of water flicked into the skillet should sizzle immediately. One at a time, drop the papadams into the hot oil. Turn the papadam when it begins to curl at the edges; it will quickly fry and become crisp. Remove it before it turns brown. Cool and drain the papadams on paper towels and eat them immediately."

Gulab Jamun,50mins,125.0 milk; 2.77 flour; 59.14 powdered milk; 2.77 self-rising flour; 14.78 milk; 0.61 ghee; 59.14 sugar; 59.14 water; 1.84 rose water; 0.30 saffron; 0.30 cardamom powder; 56.69 butter,"To Make Ghee: Put the butter in a good saucepan and bring to a boil on medium heat. Then reduce to low. Now this is what will happen as the butter slowly simmers. Moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee. The white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden. A foam will rise to the surface, and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust. The butter will cook into a gold color as well, and it will have a slightly nutty smell. When the moisture is gone, the ghee is done. Decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast, or mixed with veggies or potatoes. If you've used salted butter, you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out, but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot. Making the Scented Syrup: Combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add rose water or essence. Traditional Method: Use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick. Use a non-stick pot if you have it. Boil the milk down over medium heat, while stirring,  until it forms a paste.  Add the flour and mix into a smooth paste. Oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls, place them onto a buttered plate and set aside. Powdered-Milk Method: Combine the warm milk and ghee together. Mix the powdered milk and flour together and sprinkle slowly into the wet mix to form a dough. Oil your hands and form uniform balls (about 24) and set aside on a buttered plate. This is the most delicate part of the operation. Gentle, low heat is a must. Use a wok or karai for best results, with the ghee about 2.5-3 inches in depth. Heat the ghee on low to 215 degrees. Slip in the balls, one by one. They will sink. No touching at this point. Gently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side. After about 5 minutes they will begin to float. You will notice them getting bigger. Now, use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning. The ghee will slowly get hotter as the balls cook. After about 20 minutes, the ghee will have risen in temperature to around 245 degrees and the balls should be nice and golden. Remove a ball and put it in the syrup. If it doesn't collapse after 3 minutes, remove the others and add to the syrup. If it does collapse, fry for another 5 minutes and try again. Let soak for 2 hours at least before serving. Serve room temperature or warmed up. Enjoy your gulab jamuns!"

Gently bash the cardamom pods with a rolling pin or bottom of a heavy pan to release the seeds. Add the seeds to the cooking pan & add the sugar. Cover and cook for 20 to 25 minutes over medium heat. The vermicelli will begin to soak up the milk. Check every 5 minutes to see how much milk has been absorbed & be careful to stir occasionally. When the milk is almost completely absorbed, turn the heat as low as will go & cook with the lid off for around 10 minutes or until the noodles are separated. Serve warm in small bowls topped with the pistachios. To make this a creamy dessert, you can also spoon over a little single cream or evaporated milk! (If using the mixed fruit & nut add half of it at the time when the almonds are added & the remainder to decorate like the pistachios)."
