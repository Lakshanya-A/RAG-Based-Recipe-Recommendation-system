Return to the oven for an additional 3 minutes. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes then remove from the pan using a small spatula or butter knife. Place into a wire rack to cool completely.

Loretta Lynn Dump Cake,1hr 15mins,"chocolate cake mix, condensed milk,  caramel sauce, Cool Whip, Nestle Crunch bars","Try not to think about it. There's a reason people in this country are addicted to fatty foods that are bad for you, and this cake is going to appeal to all of those urges in you and more. Best cake in the world, remember? It's worth a shot.Preheat oven to 350. Follow the instructions on the cake mix box for baking. So, make your cake in the usual way, and when it's hot from the oven, use the cylindrical end of a large wooden spoon to poke holes in the cake. Oh, I should mention that I'd recommend the cake be baked in a 9x12 glass pan. And, the holes should be poked in neat columns and rows, let's say about an inch and a half apart. Maybe an inch. Maybe two inches. Maybe an inch and a half. Holes poked? Pour the can of condensed milk all over the cake. Pour the jar of caramel sauce all over the cake.Spread a liberal layer of Cool Whip all over the cake. While your cake was baking, you should have pounded the Nestlé Crunch bars into half-inch or less (or maybe a bit more) pieces. Now sprinkle those on top. DON'T EAT THE CAKE! If you must, if you really must, go ahead and have some, but it's not fair to judge your creation at this stage. It has not become the best cake in the world yet. Here, it's just a recipe for instant diabetic keelover. Put the cake in the refrigerator. Now you must leave that cake in there for as long as you can stand. Ideally, this means overnight. At least. But, if you're pressed for a choc fix, at least let it get nice and cold. But, again, it really is a ""this gets amazing after a day in the fridge"" recipe. And that's it. That is the very best cake in the world. Like so many precious artifacts, one would not expect to find such a powerful recipe in the hands of a kitchen simpleton such as myself, but I have come forth with the treasure. Now the world is forever changed. Or, if not the world, then your weekend, if you're smart (and want to be really, really popular with the rest of your household). Eat! Enjoy!"
Strawberry Cream Cheese Bread,1hr 10mins,"butter, sugar, cream cheese, eggs, vanilla extract, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, milk, strawberries, pecans","With electric mixer cream butter, sugar and cream cheese until fluffy.

Brazilian Brigadeiro,1hr,"sweetened condensed milk, margarine, cocoa powder, chocolate sprinkles","Cook over medium-low heat, stir vigorously the sweetened condensed milk, margarine and cocoa powder. Cook the mixture until it thickens enough to show the pan bottom during stirring. Pour the mixture in a greased dish and let it cool to room temperature. Take small amounts of the mixture with a teaspoon and make 1 ½ inch balls. Roll the balls over chocolate jimmies to decorate. Hint: Grease your hands with margarine to make the balls easily. If the balls don't hold the shape and flat down like coins, it means that you did not cook enough. Cook additional five minutes, take a small sample and dip it in a glass with cold water. If you cooked enough, this sample should hold the shape after cooling down in the water. The cheapest , low grade sweetened condensed milk is the best to make the brigadeiro because they have more starch on them, which helps the candy to hold the shape. In US, buy the sweet condensed milk from the Walmart brand  ""Great Value"", cook this brand for 20 minutes in medium heat stirring continuously and your brigadeiro is with the right consistency."

Pina Colada Pineapple Cakes,1hr 50mins,"yellow candy melts, green candy melts, standard box white cake mix, vanilla instant pudding mix, water, light rum, vegetable oil, eggs, crushed pineapple, unsweetened dried shredded coconut, Cool Whip, yellow food coloring, semi-sweet chocolate chips","Place the yellow candy melts into a medium, heatproof bowl. Fill a small pot of water with a 2-inch depth of water. Set over a low heat with the bowl of yellow candy melts on top. Stir until the yellow candy melts have melted and are smooth. Remove from the heat. Drop a small dollop (about 1/4 to 1/8 tsp) of the melted candy melt onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Using a small, offset spatula make a brushstroke motion over the dollop of candy melt to spread it out into a thin oval. Repeat this with all of the melted yellow candy melts – you may need to re-melt it in the bowl if it’s starting to set. Chill for 15-20 minutes until set. Place the green candy melts into a small, heatproof bowl. Fill a small pot of water with a 2-inch depth of water. Set over a low heat with the bowl of green candy melts on top. Stir until the green candy melts have melted and are smooth. Remove from the heat. Drop a small dollop of green candy melt onto a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Use a brushstroke motion (similar to before, but in a longer motion to make a longer stripe) to make one thin, long leaf. Repeat with dollops of candy melt close together, connecting them at the base, to make the green leaf crown. Repeat with the green candy melts to make a total of 6 crowns. Chill for 15-20 minutes until set. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease two quarter-sheet pans (9 x 13 inches). In a large bowl, mix the white cake mix, half the vanilla pudding mix, all of the vegetable oil, the 4 eggs, the water and half of the rum. Drain the crushed pineapple but reserve the juice. Add half of the crushed pineapple to the cake batter along with all of the shredded coconut.  Fold together to combine. Divide the cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans, spreading out into even layers. Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden and a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Let cool completely before assembly. In a large bowl combine the remaining crushed pineapple, remaining light rum, the reserved pineapple juice and remaining vanilla pudding mix, stirring until smooth and thickened. Fold in the thawed cool whip. Add the yellow food colouring and fold together to combine. Remove the cooled cake layers from the baking sheets. Use a 3-inch round cookie cutter to punch out 9 circles from each of the cake layers (so you have a total of eighteen 3-inch circles). Stack 3 cake circles on top of each other, sandwiching them together with 1 tbsp frosting between each layer. Repeat so you get six small 3-layer cakes. Use a serrated knife to carefully carve each small cake into a pineapple shape. Cover each small cake with frosting in an even layer. Cover with the chilled yellow candy melt ovals: start at the top of the cake, layering in rings going around the cake, allowing the candy melts to overlap slightly, until each cake is completely covered. Transfer the melted semisweet chocolate chips to a disposable piping bag. Snip off the very tip so you have a tiny opening. Pipe dots of dark chocolate randomly onto the yellow candy melts to represent the ‘eyes’ of the pineapple. Top each cake with one of the green candy melt crowns. Serve. Adding shredded coconut to your cakes will make it easier to trim into pineapple shapes – the coconut addition is not shown in the recipe video."

Decadent Krispies Bar,30mins,"cooking spray, light brown sugar, unsalted butter, ground cinnamon, miniature marshmallows, sliced almonds, dried apricot, Rice Krispies, white chocolate chips, canola oil, Grand Marnier","This bar comes together rather quickly. Begin by preparing a 9 by 9 inch pan with a good coating of cooking spray and set aside.  Also apply a bit of spray to your cooking spoon (preferably wooden). If your almonds are not already toasted, place them in a dry non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, routinely tossing the almonds around the pan. The almonds should add just a small amount of color and become slightly aromatic. To make the bars, begin by adding the butter and brown sugar together in a large sauce pan over medium to low heat. Stir while the both the butter and sugar melt for 2 minutes or so.  The result is smooth to the feel with a wooden spoon.  In addition, you should be able to move  it about the bottom of the pan with the spoon (sort of a blob). Add in the 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and stir. Add the miniature marshmallows and stir continuously helping the puffs to melt. Continue mixing until you have a pale brown mixture that is still rather loose. This is where things begin to move fast.  Once the marshmallows are fully melted and mixed with the sugar, add in the Rice Krispies, almonds and apricots. Stir quickly to get all of the ingredients incorporated. Turn the mixture out into the 9 by 9 inch pan, distributing as much as possible using your spoon. To level the bars in the pan, give your palms a quick shot of cooking spray and pat down. Place the bars in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set. Invert pan and give the pan a good whack to release the Krispies bar.  Slice into 12 pieces (4 by 3). Melt white chocolate chips in a double boiler over very low heat.  (If you do not have a double boiler, you can fashion one using a large bowl over a smaller saucepan. Just be certain the fit is tight and no steam is being released). Add the oil to the chocolate and stir while the the chips continue to melt.  If the chocolate begins to harden, this is sign the heat is too high and you should lower the flame or remove the top half of the double boiler from the bottom. Stir the Grand Marnier into the melted chocolate and use a spoon to stripe the bars on the diagonal allowing the melted chocolate to drip down the side.  If you are a big fan of white chocolate, you can skip the drizzling and just dunk the bars into the white chocolate and place on waxed paper to cool. (Timesaver tip:  If you want to speed things up a bit.  You can melt the chocolate after placing the bars in the pan and drizzle over the entire pan before cooling and cutting.  Not quite as pretty, but just as tasty)."

Individual Baked Alaska,42mins,"bittersweet chocolate, heavy whipping cream, frozen raspberries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, salt, sponge cake, jelly-roll style, ice cream, egg white, granulated sugar, light corn syrup, water, confectioners' sugar","To make the chocolate sauce: chop the chocolate to a rough consistency. Heat the cream just to a scald, then pour over the chocolate. Do not stir. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, then stir with a whisk until smooth. Makes about 1 cup. To make the raspberry sauce: Puree the raspberries in a blender with the remaining ingredients. Strain through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds. Refrigerate until needed. Makes about 1 cup. To assemble the ice-cream bases: line a baking sheet with parchment. Using a 3"" round cookie cutter (or a glass) cut 6 circles out of the cake, and place them on the parchment. Place a scoop of ice cream in the center of each piece of cake, making sure you leave a small margin of cake visible all the way around. Place in the freezer until the meringue is ready. To prepare the meringue: combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy, 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then cook until the syrup reaches 230 degrees F. (thread stage) on a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of your mixer, and fit the whip attachment to your mixer. When the syrup reaches the thread stage, start whipping your egg whites on high speed. When the syrup reaches 245-250 degrees F. (firm-ball stage), lower the speed of the mixer to low, and very, very, VERY slowly start pouring the syrup in, in a slow, steady, thin stream until it is all used up. Immediately return the mixer to high speed and continue whipping until the meringue reaches a very stiff peaked consistency. Transfer the meringue to a piping bag fit with a plain tip. Remove the ice cream bases from the freezer. Now you are going to create a meringue""beehive"" around each scoop of ice cream. I find it easier to do this by removing one ice-cream scoop at a time to a cake turntable or a flat-work surface that I can spin around, like a small plate, pipe the meringue, then using a thin spatula, returning it carefully to the parchment. To pipe the meringue you need to start at the bottom edge of the cake, pipe a ring of meringue around the icecream so that it completely covers the cake edge. Then continue to pipe a line of meringue all around the scoop of ice cream, making sure you completely cover the ice cream, and that each line of meringue rests on top of the previous one. Finish with a small circle at the top. Repeat with remaining ice cream bases. Return them to the freezer until ready to serve. Just before service, decorate your plate: choose an oversize plate, like a dinner plate. Then using the sauces, paint or spoon or swirl them on to your hearts content. Any design you like. I like to just use squiggles, but anything goes at this point. Now- if you don't have a torch, you will need to turn your oven to broil. If you have a torch, get it ready. Remove the meringues from the freezer, and dust the top of each one with the confectioners sugar in a fine mesh strainer. If you are using a broiler, place the baking sheet under the broiler but leave the door open and watch. You will only need about 30-45 seconds, just enough time for the meringue to turn golden brown. Remove from the oven, place one in the center of each plate, and serve. If you are using a torch, turn your torch to a med-low setting, and carefully, gently use the torch to brown the outside of the meringues. Place one meringue on each plate, and serve. Notes: You can use any type of cake you want here- this recipe is more a method than anything. I've used chocolate chiffon as a base, I've used spongecake, poundcake, leftover slices of cupcakes! Anything, anyflavor, but it needs to be at least 1/4"" thick. You can also use any flavor ice-cream- experiment, go wild. Sorbet is great this way- I've done mango sorbet, and lime sorbet- they taste terrific. Experiment, have fun, and don't be intimidated by this dessert. It's fun, and it's easy, and your friends and relatives will""oooohhhh! ""and""ahhhhh! ""you to death!"

Glaze:  Bring the 1 c powdered sugar, wine and butter to a boil; the glaze will be fairly thin. While the cake is still warm and in the Bundt pan, pour half of the glaze on the cake. Let the cake sit for 30 minutes to absorb the glaze. Turn the cake out of the pan and completely cool. Thicken the remaining half of the glaze with additional powdered sugar and pour over the cake. (NOTE:  I tried to put in just additional powdered sugar to thicken the glaze, but it wouldn't accept it without an amount.  I'm guessing on the additional amount that I actually used.  I think it was about an additional cup of powdered sugar to thicken the glaze to the consistency that I wanted.  Of course, you can use the amount necessary to thicken to the consistency that you like)."

Gooey Butter Cake,50mins,"butter, yellow cake mix, eggs, cream cheese, pure vanilla extract, confectioners' sugar","Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease (or spray with Pam) one deep 9x13 rectangular cake pan. I would suggest a 4 in deep pan, as the cake rises when it is cooking, but a oven-safe disposable coffee cake pan from the grocery store would work fine too. Melt butter. I do this by heating the the microwave on low power for 30 seconds. Empty cake mix into a large bowl. Stir melted butter, along with ONE egg, into the cake mix. PRESS mixture into pan. Mixture will have the consistency of sticky dough. Using a spatula works for me, but pressing with clean fingers will do the trick as well. In a large bowl, mix cream cheese, almond or vanilla extract, confectioners sugar and the remaining two eggs. Beat for three minutes with an electric mixer set on medium high speed, or until smooth with NO lumps. Pour evenly over top of the cake mixture in the pan. Use a spatula to spread. Place a large cookie sheet on the rack below the cake. Sometimes when you use a cake pan with less depth, the cake bubbles and spills over. The cookie sheet will spare your oven! Bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes until golden brown on top. Cooking time is estimated, you will really have to watch it here! I always take the cake out when it turns a darkish golden brown. Note that there will be a paper thin sugar ""crust"" that will form while the cake is baking. It the top layer of sugar hardening, and this is what will turn golden brown. It adds great texture! Allow cake to cool COMPLETELY. This is very important, as the cake will not cut easily until it is completely cool. You will notice that the cake has sunken and set. This is normal. Refrigeration is optional. I personally like it at room temperature. Dust the top with confectioners’ sugar. Cut cake into bars and serve with or without utensils, but make sure you have plenty of napkins, because this treat will have you licking your fingers!  (Cake should be gooey underneath the sugar ""crust"", so don't over bake!)."

For your brownie batter: Melt your butter in a medium (or large) heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. While the butter is melting, whisk the cocoa powder, sea salt and sugar in a separate bowl. (The sugar and salt will work as abrasive agents to get any lumps out of the cocoa.) Whisk the cocoa/sugar/salt combo into the melted butter until the sugar has dissolved fully. The mixture should look like fudge and pull away from the bowl into a ball. Take off the stove and set the pan on a dishtowel on your counter. Allow the fudgy mixture to cool down until it's warm, but not hot anymore. While that is cooling, line the bottom and sides of your 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper or foil. You want to leave about 4 inches of overhang on the 2 opposite sides. These serve as your handles to remove the brownies from the pan in 1 piece, so make sure that there is enough of the overhang for you to have a solid grip. Grease the parchment or foil well. Stir in the vanilla into the cooled fudge mixture to loosen it up. Add the eggs into the mixture 1 at a time, adding the second egg after the first egg is fully incorporated. The batter should look shiny and well blended. Add in your flour and stir it until it's fully incorporated. Once it looks fully blended, beat the batter vigorously for at least 45 strokes. This'll not only get out any pent up stress, but it will make the brownies chewy. Fold in your chocolate chips. Spread the very thick and fudgy brownie batter evenly in the lined pan with an offset spatula or your greased hands. Pop the brownies in the oven and bake until they get a nice crust and your house smells like brownies, 30 to 35 minutes. Let them cool completely on a rack or a dishtowel on your counter. While the brownies are cooling make the buttercream and ganache. For the buttercream: Mix your peanut butter and butter together in a stand mixer until they are totally blended. Turn your mixer down and slowly add your powdered sugar and fine sea salt. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Turn your mixer back to medium, add your milk and vanilla and keep mixing until it's fully blended. Dollop the peanut butter buttercream in heaping spoonfuls on top of the cooled brownies. Evenly spread it with the back of a butter knife the over the surface. Scatter the peanuts evenly over the buttercream, pressing into the buttercream so that the ganache has something to hold on to and the peanuts are all covered. For the ganache: Melt the chocolate chips and butter together in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Allow the ganache to cool down slightly for 10 minutes or so, then pour it evenly over the peanut butter buttercream layer. Smooth the ganache out with the back of a butter knife, making sure to cover the buttercream and peanuts completely. Chill the brownies in the refrigerator until the toppings are set, 1 1/2 hours or so. Remove these delicious guys from the refrigerator. Lift up the ends of the foil liner and place the Fudgy Salty Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownies on a cutting board. Cut into squares. Enjoy!"

Remove the cake from the oven and let cool for 20 minutes in the pan. Loosen the edges of the cake with a small spatula or butter knife, flip the cake out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely. In a small bowl, stir together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder and milk until smooth. Spoon over the top of the cooled cake, letting it drip down the sides of the cake.
