Baked Potato Samosas,55mins,"potatoes, salt, extra virgin olive oil, onion, jalapeno pepper, gingerroot, garlic clove, ground coriander, curry powder, ground cumin, ground allspice, cinnamon, black pepper, tomato,  frozen peas, vegetable stock, flour,refrigerated ready made pie dough, egg, fresh mint leaves, fresh cilantro leaves, jalapeno pepper, seeds and stem removed, sugar, limes, extra virgin olive oil, garlic clove, gingerroot ","Preheat oven to 400*F. Cook the potatoes in a large pan of boiling salted water until tender, 5-7 minutes. Drain and reserve in the same pot you cooked them inches. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, 5 minutes, then addd the jalapeno, ginger, garlic, coriander, curry powder, cumin, allspice, cinnamon, and salt and pepper. Cook for about 3 minutes more. Stir in the drained potatoes, tomato, and peas. Cook for another minute. Stir in enough of the stock to moisten the mixture, then remove it from the heat and let cool. On a lightly floured surface, unroll ;the pie dough. Cut each dough round into 8 equal wedges, like a pizza. Spoon 1 tbls. of the potato filling onto the middle of each wedge. Brush the edges of the dough with the egg wash and fold up, bringing the three points together over the filling, then pinching at the seams to form a small pyramid. Transfer to a baking sheet and brush the samosas with the egg wash. Bake 15-20 minutes, until golden brown. Combine the mint, cilantro, jalapeno, sugar, salt, lime juice, 1 tbls. water, and the oil in the bowl of a food processor. Grate the garlic and ginger directly into the bowl, then puree until smooth. Transfer to a small serving bowl. Serve the samosas hot out of the oven with the mint cilatro dipping sauce."
Onion Bhaji,20mins,"gram flour, chili powder, turmeric, baking powder, fennel seed, onion seeds, cumin seed, onions, green chilies, fresh coriander leaves, water, oil ","Sift the flour, chilli powder, turmeric, baking powder and salt together in a bowl. Get as much air into it as possible. Crush the seeds in mortar and pestle, add to the bowl. Now add the green chilli, onions and the chopped coriander. Mix in some water to make a thick batter that holds the ingredients together. Heat the oil in a wok. Drop spoonfulls of the batter into the oil and fry till golden brown. Place on kitchen paper to allow the excess oil to run off. These can be eaten as they are or with a dip."
Gulab Jamun,50mins,"powdered milk, all-purpose flour, baking soda, butter, milk, sugar, water, cardamom pods, saffron threads, oil (for frying)","Make the dough by combining the milk powder, flour, butter. Add just enough whole milk to make a medium-hard dough. Divide the dough into 18-20 portions. Make balls by gently rolling each portion between your palms into a smooth ball. Place the balls on a plate. Cover with a damp yet dry kitchen towel. Heat the oil on high and then lower the heat to medium. Slip in the balls into the hot oil from the side of the pan, one by one. They will sink to the bottom of the pan, but do not try to move them. Instead, gently shake the pan to keep the balls from browning on just one side. After about 5 mins, the balls will rise to the surface. The Gulab Jamuns should rise slowly to the top if the temperature is just right. Now they must be gently and constantly agitated to ensure even browning on all sides. If the temperature of the oil is too high then the gulab jamuns will tend to break. So adjust the temperature to ensure that the gulab jamuns do not break or cook too quickly. The balls must be fried very slowly under medium temperatures. This will ensure complete cooking from inside and even browning. The syrup should be made earlier and kept warm. To make the hot sugar syrup add mix the 2 cups of sugar to 1 cup of water. Add 4-5 cardamom pods, slightly crushed and a few strands of Kesar (Saffron). Mix with a spoon and then heat at medium heat for 5-10 minutes until sugar is all dissolved in water. Do not overheat, that will caramelize the sugar. Transfer this hot syrup into a serving dish. Keep warm on stove. Add the fried gulab jamuns directly into the warm syrup. Leave gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup overnight for best results. They can be served warm or at room temperature."
Mango Mint Chutney,1hr 15mins,"extra virgin olive oil, onion, red chili pepper flakes, ginger, mangoes, curry powder, honey, white wine vinegar, water, lemon, mint","To make the chutney, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil a medium sauce pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook until golden and caramelized, about 8-10 minutes. Stir in chili flakes, ginger, mango, curry powder, honey, white wine vinegar and water. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until liquid has reduced by half and chutney has thickened, about 25-30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon zest and mint. Allow to cool to room temperature, then transfer to a jar and seal it tightly before refrigerating."
Puran Poli,1hr,"whole wheat flour, water, salt, oil, ghee, cooked peas, sugar, green cardamom pods, saffron strands, nutmeg","Method: Filling. Warm two tablespoons of ghee in a nonstick saucepan. As it melts, add the cooked pigeon peas, and stir until the water evaporates and the mixture thickens. Continually scrape the sides of the saucepan to ensure even distribution of heat or else the daal will burn. Add half the sugar and stir it in well. Adjust to desired sweetness. Reduce the heat and continue to thicken until the mashed pigeon peas resemble mashed potatoes. Add the crushed cardamom powder, saffron and nutmeg, stir well and portion into eight pieces. This filling can be made up to 3 days in advance, and stored in the fridge until ready to use. Bring it to room temperature to ease the rolling process. Method: Dough. Using a food processor fitted with an S blade or in a large bowl, combine the flour with salt and enough water to make a firm dough. The dough should be firm but not hard, moist but not wet, and similar in consistency of modeling clay. Carefully knead the oil into the dough and cover with a clear wrap or lid until ready to roll. Method: Rolling & Cooking. Start by rolling out a single ball of dough into a flat disk, as one would begin a paratha, no more than 5” diameter. Place the mashed sweetened pigeon peas mash, puran, in the center, pinch the dough and fold over the ball to cover the ball completely, like a dumpling. Ensure the seams are sealed. Lightly flatten this in the palm of your hand. Dredge the ball in dry flour and begin to roll again, this time very lightly to ensure the filling does not spill out. Roll to make an 8” poli using dry flour to dust as needed. When sufficiently rolled, dust off excess flour. Heat a shallow nonstick pan on medium-high heat. When ready to place a Puran poli in the pan, turn it down to medium heat. The side that hits the pan first is the first side. Watch the dough bubble slightly and move it around in the pan without flipping it over. Turn the Puran poli over approximately 1 minute later. The first side should be lightly spotted but not have dark spots. If this happens too quickly, reduce the heat. Repeat on the second side, and while the second side cooks, lightly baste the first side of the with ghee. Using a spatula, flip the paratha and repeat the basting. Both sides should have ghee—cooked once without ghee and once with ghee. Remove from heat and cover with a paper towel or a colander to help the steam evaporate. Once they have come to room temperature, the Puran Poli can be transferred to an appropriate storage container."
Ginger Lemonade,15mins,"water, sugar, rock salt, ginger, cumin, lemon juice, mint","Boil 1 cup water with sugar, rock salt, ginger, and cumin to make a simple syrup. Add remaining water and lemon juice. Chill to ice cold. Pour over ice or blend with ice."

Add chicken pieces and marinate for 25-30 minutes. Dry-roast coriander seeds in frying pan over a medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add cumin seeds and dry-roast for 30 seconds. Grind these spices in blender, or mortar & pestle, then mix them in non-metallic bowl with other ingredients for second marinade. Salt to taste, and add chicken pieces. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto metal or pre-soaked wooden skewers. Pre-heat a grill, chargrill or grill pan to hot. Grill the skewered chicken, turning a few times, so that the chicken gets cooked evenly from all sides. Remove the chicken from the grill. Take the pieces off the skewers and place on a plate. For tomato masala heat ghee, or oil in frying pan. When the ghee is ready, turn the heat to medium-high and fry coriander seeds and cinnamon stick for 1 minute. Add bay leaves, cloves, green cardamoms and black peppercorns, and fry for 1 more minute. Now add halfed tomatoes and stir for 2-3 minutes. Add 125 ml of hot water, bring to the boil, reduce the heat to medium, and cover with a lid. After 20 minutes remove skin from the tomatoes and continue to simmer until the tomatoes have completely disintegrated. Now remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaves from tomato masala and blend it with a hand-held blender and pass it through a sieve to obtain smooth puree. Set this masala aside. For the gravy heat the ghee in frying pan. When the ghee is hot, add the onions and reduce the heat to medium. Fry for 10-15 minutes, or until onions are tender and golden. In the meantime, put almonds and desiccated coconut in blender and grind to powder. Now grind this almond-coconut powder with double cream and a little water to make a fine paste. When the onions are golden add garlic, ginger, and green chillies, and fry for 1 minute. Then add turmeric, paprika  and cumin and saute for 30 seconds. Put in the tomato masala, almond-coconut paste, tomato paste, honey and 125 ml of hot water. Cook for 10 minutes, or until sauce starts to thicken. Remove the curry sauce from the heat, and blend it again with the hand-held blender until smooth. Return to a clean pan, reheat again and add cheddar cheese. When the cheese is melted, slowly whisk in the cream. Add dry fenugreek leaves, garam masala and salt to taste. Put in the chicken pieces and stir for 3-4 minutes over medium heat. To finish the dish, stir in the chopped coriander leaves. Serve with naan bread or pilau rice."
Naan,40mins,"flour, baking powder, salt, plain low-fat yogurt","Mix together flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in the yogurt till the dough is too stiff for a spoon, then knead it in the bowl till it holds together well, adding more flour if necessary. Turn it out on a floured surface and continue kneading for about 5 minutes till the dough feels smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball and put it in an oiled bowl, covered with a towel, to rest for an hour or longer. Take the dough out and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Form each into a ball and press the balls flat into round discs. Heat a large frying pan or griddle, either seasoned cast iron or a good non-stick finish. Heat your oven to about 500 and have the broiler on (this is how the original recipe states it - I know with my oven it's either 500 degree oven OR the broiler, but you get the idea. Take 1 piece of dough at a time and roll it out on a floured surface till it is about 8-10 inches across and less than 1/4 inch thick. Lay it on the hot griddle and cook it over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes (I don't think mine took that long). It will puff up in places or all over, and there will be some blackish-brown spots on the bottom. Slide a spatula under the naan and transfer it to the oven, directly onto the rack, for a minute or two, just till it finishes puffing up into a balloon and begins to color lightly on top. Remove naan from the oven and brush it lightly with melted butter if you like. Continue this way with all the dough, stacking the breads into a napkin-lined basket. Serve the breads hot, fresh from the oven, or let them cool and wrap them up. To reheat, wrap them in aluminum foil, in packets of 4 or 5 breads and put them in a 400 degree oven for 10-15 minutes."
Carrot Halwa,1hr 30mins,"ghee, carrot, evaporated milk, sugar, khoya, almonds, water, saffron, cardamom powder","Grate khoya and keep aside. Combine carrots and milk in a large heavy based pan. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and cook the carrots, stirring constantly, until all the milk dries up. Pour ghee into the carrots. Add khoya. Saute for a few minutes. Add sugar. Continue to cook and stir the carrot mixture till it dries. Remove from heat when still moist. Stir in the saffron, cardamom powder and almonds, reserving a few for garnish along with silver foil. Reheat carrot halwa just before serving with a little milk. If not serving immediately, refrigerate carrot halwa and re-heat and serve when desired. Handy hint: If u dont have khoya, use 1 cup whole milk powder mixed with 1 tsp ghee and 1-2 tbsp water to get a dough like consistency. This makes 100gms of khoya."
Dal Chilla,1hr 30mins,"sunflower oil, chutney, split yellow lentils, water,  fresh gingerroot, green chili pepper, coriander leaves, salt, semolina, onion, salt, green chili pepper","Soak the lentils in 250ml (9fl oz) of the measured water for about ?1 hour, until they absorb it all. Transfer the lentils to a blender and add the ginger, chilli, and coriander and blend until smooth. Tip the paste into a bowl and stir in the salt, semolina and the remaining 350ml (12fl oz) measured water, mixing well. Combine all the topping ingredients in a bowl. Heat a frying pan and, once it is very hot, pour a serving-spoonful of the batter into the pan and spread it into a 13–15-cm (5–6-inch) circle. Top with 1 tablespoon of the topping mixture and drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil around the edges of the batter. Cook over medium heat for 2–3 minutes, until golden brown on the underside, then turn the chilla over and cook for a further 2 minutes, until golden brown on both sides. Repeat to make 15 more.

Homemade Jalebis,45mins,"all-purpose flour, gram flour, plain yogurt, water, baking soda, ghee, sugar syrup","Put flour in a mixing bowl. Add gramflour. Mix well. Add yogurt and water. Mix well, using a spoon, ensuring that no lumps remain. Mix to obtain what is technically called,""ribbon consistency"". (Ribbon consistency simply requires you to mix for about 5-7 minutes, really well, so that when the mixture is dropped from the mixing spoon into the mixing bowl, it should fall like a ribbon. Don't let the term scare you, it's pretty easy, you just got to). Add a pinch of baking soda. At this point, this mixture (batter) can be refrigerated if you are planning on making the jalebis later. If you plan to make the jalebis instantly, put the mixture in a jalebi bottle (you get these bottles to make jalebis in the market). If you dont have a jalebi bottle, you can use an empty well-washed and thoroughly clean, tomato ketchup bottle. If you got an icing bag, use that. I used the icing bag with the""star"" nozzle attachment. You may experiment with the other nozzles, if you wish, but please dont, in any circumstances, try using the""writing"" nozzle attachment, because if you do so, the jalebis that you'll be making will be the thinnest on the face of the planet,lol. Heat oil on low-medium flame in a frying pan. Meanwhile, spoon the above prepared batter in the icing bag fitted with the star nozzle/jalebi bottle/ tomato ketchup bottle. Drop the batter by squeezing the bottle/icing bag, into the hot oil, in concentric circular motion to make the jalebis. Lightly brown on either side. Repeat until all the batter is used up. On low flame heat the pre-prepared sugar-water syrup (known in Hindi as""chashni""). Add few threads of saffron to the syrup- these look really pretty on the jalebis later when you dip the latter into them. Now, drain the excess oil from the jalebis. Drop into the sugar-water syrup. Dip well, toss well, to coat the jalebis in the syrup. Drain excess syrup from the jalebis. Serve immediately or serve hot if you plan to serve them later on, make sure to warm them a bit in the oven (2-3 minutes) and then serve. Get ready to put on your apron and go make more of these because they'll vanish before you know! Don't blame ME if you get addicted to these like my DAD."
Kulfi,12hrs,"fat-free evaporated milk, light cream, low fat  sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon","In a large bowl, stir together well the evaporated milk, condensed milk, cream, and optional other flavor. Pour into popsicle molds, Indian stainless steel kulfi molds, or even a small bowl. Freeze overnight. Remove from the molds by resting their bottoms very briefly in warm to hot water (if you do this for too long you'll have a gooey mess!)."
Thandai (Indian Almond Drink),15mins,"water, sugar, almonds, sunflower seeds, poppy seed, anise seed, ground cardamom, rose water, peppercorn,  rose petal","Soak sugar in 1/2 litre of the water used. Set aside. Soak remaining ingredients in 2 cups of remaining water. Set aside. Allow all soaked items to stand for at least 2 hours. Grind all soaked ingredients to a very fine paste. (not sugar) in a processor or blender. Place a double layer of cheesecloth or a coffee filter over/in a strainer and set over a large container/pitcher. Press through muslin with the back of a spoon, extracting as much liquid as possible. Add remaining water, a little at a time to extract more of the nut liquid. Pour back some of the extract and press, repress.  Do this a number of times to extract as much flavour out of the nut paste as possible. Mix well. Chill for atleast 2 hours before serving.  You may need to give the drink a stir before pouring. To serve, sprinkle some rose petals over each serving (optional). Note:  Do not discard the nut paste - it is excellent used in making korma-type curries."
Burfi (Indian Fudge),1hr 30mins,"butter, brown sugar, white sugar, milk, powdered milk, cashews, pistachios","Melt the butter over low heat. Stir in sugars. Add the milk and bring to a boil gradually over medium heat. Lower the flame and add the powdered milk slowly, stirring to work out all the lumps. If you're adding nuts, mix them in once the lumps are smoothed out. Cook on medium heat for approximately 4-5 minutes, until nice and thick. Butter a 9x13 inch cake pan and pour mixture into pan, spread evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge to set - the girls stick it in the freezer so they don't have to wait so long :). Once set, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares. Keep refrigerated and covered with plastic wrap. One hour of prep time is actual cooling time. Makes approximately 60 small squares."
Murmura / Chiwda,35mins,"oil, cumin seed, fresh ginger, curry leaves, dried red chilies, hing, raisins, unsalted peanuts, sev, coconut, unsweetened rice puffs, salt, sugar, lime juice","Sift and pick through the puffed rice, discard discolored pieces.

Add cumin seeds, ginger and curry leaves. Stir vigorously to season the oil well, reduce the heat. Add dried red chilies, asafetida powder and turmeric powder; stir vigorously to avoid burning. Add the raisins and peanuts, allow them to cook. As the peanuts begin to roast, add the salt, sugar and lime juice; turn off the heat. While the oil and spices are still hot, add the cooled toasted puffed rice and sev in small batches. Toss with two flat spatulas with each addition until all the rice is mixed inches Return the wok to a medium-low heat and toss this mixture quickly. Remove from heat. Serve hot or allow to cool and store it in an airtight container for up to four weeks."
Shankarpale,45mins,"flour, oil, water, sugar, oil","Put the oil in a thick bottom pan. Add water and sugar. Stir and bring to a boil. Remove from heat immediately. Let it stand until it is lukewarm. Fold in the flour adding a little at a time. Knead well. Heat oil in a deep frying pan. Divide the dough into lemon sized balls and roll out with a rolling pin. You should not be able to see the surface you are rolling it on through the dough. Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife cut into strips at an angle. Turn the surface 90 degrees and cut diagonally to form diamonds. If you don't cut at an angle you will get squares, diamonds look better. Deep fry in the oil until golden brown. Store in a air tight container."
Tandoori Chicken,1hr 10mins,"plain yogurt, lemon juice, allspice, fresh coarse ground black pepper, ground cayenne pepper, ground cinnamon, ground cumin, ground ginger, salt, smoked paprika, garlic, thai chili paste with garlic, chicken, onions, lemon","In a small mixing bowl, stir together the yogurt and lemon juice.  Add the spices, minced garlic, and chili paste, and whisk until you have a smooth, thick marinade. Put 6 pieces of the chicken in each of two zip-lock bags, and add 1/2 the marinade to each bag.  Zip closed and knead the bags until the chicken is well-coated with marinade.  Open bags slightly, squeeze out most of the air, and zip closed again.  Refrigerate 12-24 hours.  If serving this for dinner, I usually make the marinade and start the chicken soaking the evening before. Turn the bags and knead the marinating chicken once or twice while it's in the refrigerator. When you are ready to cook, take the chicken out of the refrigerator, line a large roasting pan with foil, lay a rack over the pan so air can circulate under the roasting chicken, and pre-heat your oven to 425.  If you have a convection bake or convection roast cycle, use that. Place the chicken pieces on the rack so they are not touching.  Empty what is left of the marinade into a bowl or measuring cup and touch up any ""empty"" spots on the chicken pieces with the marinade. Once the oven is hot, put the pan with the chicken in the oven, and leave the door closed (no peeking!).  Turn the chicken pieces once after 30 minutes of cooking time, then roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly charred on the second side, but no more than 15 minutes for legs and thighs.  If you are cooking breasts, poke one with a skewer to make sure the juices run clear. NOW TURN THE OVEN OFF, and let the chicken rest in the closed oven for 20-30 minutes more (not critical, but NO PEEKING!). Remove the chicken to a warm platter, garnish with the onion rings and a few squeezes of lemon, and enjoy! See if you don't agree this is as good as any ""authentic"" Tandoori chicken you've ever tried!"

Add all other ingredients except crescent rolls. Stir gently over medium heat for several minutes until well incorporated. Set aside. Heat oven to 375°F. Open cans of crescent rolls and unroll the dough. Separate into 4 rectangles and pinch the triangular perforations to seal. Cut each rectangle in half crosswise to make squares (you'll have 8 squares per can of crescent rolls). You may have to coax the dough gently with your hands to make it square and to close up the perforations.

Mini Strawberry Falooda,1hr 5mins,"tapioca, strawberry jam, rose water, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, strawberry","The tapioca is best made the night before so that it has time to chill. To begin, measure out 1 part tapioca to 8 parts water and add to a large pot. Bring to a boil. Once at a boil, reduce to a simmer, and stir pot. Make sure to stir at least once every 10 minutes, for about 60 minutes. Don't be afraid to add extra water if the water levels are looking low.  It is much better to add more than to let the tapiocas run dry and stick to the pan. Once the tapiocas are cooked all the way through, strain the tapiocas and immediately run cold water over them. When the tapioca pearls are cooled down, pack in water and store until eating. The next day, or whenever ready to eat falood, take out the tapioca, add rosewater, and stir inches  I added about 1 tablespoon for about 6 cups of tapioca pearls. IF you do not like floral tastes, add less. To assemble the falooda: add a tablespoon or two of jam to each glass of falooda. Next, add the tapioca pearls, then add vanilla ice cream to the top. if using strawberries and whipped cream, you can add these to the top. You can also do layers of each of the components. Enjoy!

Roti,2hrs,"all-purpose flour, water, milk, salt, oil, butter, flour","Put flour and salt in a bowl. Add water a cup at a time, kneading. When kneading, make your hand into a fist and roll your knuckles into the dough, folding edges in continuously, working in all the flour. When all the flour is kneaded into a ball, poke lots of holes into the ball of dough. Pour a little oil into the dough and knead it inches. Add the rest of the oil (the dough will look very oily and that's the way it should be). Cover with a clean cloth and let sit for at least an hour. Roll the ball in a little bit of flour so it's not sticky. Divide the dough into about 15-20 balls depending on how big you want the chappatis to be. Flour the counter/board. Roll out each ball to about 6 inches in diameter. Brush with melted butter. Fold in three (like you fold a letter). Now it should almost look like a long tube. Take one end of that tube and fold it in to the centre and gently press it inches. Take the other end of the tube and fold it over the seam. Now you should have a little bundle of dough. (In other words, fold the dough into thirds one way, and then the other). Flour a plate and place the bundles on them. Roll each one out to about 6-8 inch diamete, flouring counter/board as needed. On a flat cast iron disc (available at Indian grocery stores) or on a big frying pan (cast iron is best), heat pan, and put chappati on it. When it starts looking a bit translucent, flip it over. Brush with melted butter, shuffling it around the pan quickly, then a quick flip over, a bit of melted butter (it should start puffing up into a pillow like shape). Once it has small golden brown dots on both sides, take it off an put into a serving dish (cover with a clean cloth as you keep preparing the rest). You will have to adjust the heat during the whole frying process. Clean off the pan with paper towels or a clean cloth in between frying each chappati. Don't turn the chappatis too much, just once or twice is enough."

Chicken Curry,1hr 10mins,"onions, garlic cloves, ginger, chicken drumsticks, chicken thighs, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon bark, tomatoes, chili powder, turmeric, cumin, salt, chilies","1) Peel and cut up onions into 6-8 pieces each (something that will fit into a food processor or a blender). Peel garlic and ginger. 2)Put onions, garlic, and ginger into food processor or blender with a spoon of water. Blend/grate into a rough paste. Does not need to be super smooth. 3) Prep the chicken - take skins off if you bought chicken with the skin on. Rinse the chicken with water and pat dry. Create slits in the pieces randomly with a knife so that the spices can get into the meat. 4) Take about 4 spoons of the onion, garlic, ginger paste and the spices (Indian chili powder, turmeric, cumin) and coat the chicken with it all.  Add the salt as well. NOTE RE SPICES: we never measure these spices, but ratios help. For this part of the recipe, smaller amounts of each chili powder, cumin, and turmeric are fine - let's say one spoon of each, more of the chili powder if you want it spicy. 5) Place a 6-8 quart pot on medium-high heat. Add a turn or two of canola oil, enough to evenly coat the bottom of the pot. When the oil is heated through, add cloves, cardamom (try to open them up a bit), and cinnamon bark. Stir the whole spices around a little until fragrant. 6) Once you start smelling the whole spices, add the rest of your onion/garlic/ginger paste. Cook until the paste starts to take on a slightly reddish color. Add larger amounts of the spices now. I will do two generous shakes of the chili powder (I like my curries spicy), one shake of ground cumin, and one shake of turmeric. If it looks too brown, I will add some turmeric and chili powder because I want it to be a little brighter. 7) Add the chicken after the paste and spices incorporate. Stir frequently so the chicken does not stick to the pot. Once all the chicken turns opaque on the outside, cover with a lid, lower the heat to medium and let everything cook together for about 20 minutes. 8) After 20 minutes, check the pot to see if any liquid has come out. This is the curry! If it looks dry, add some a couple cups of hot water to the pot, but only if it looks totally dry. Stir the chicken and recover the pot, lower the heat a little more, and let it all simmer/stew together for another 20 minutes. 9) 15 minutes into the second 20 minutes, add the Thai chilies. Make sure they are washed. If you want more of the heat to come out of the chilies, make one diagonal slit in each chili. Adding the chilies is optional. 10) At the end of the 20 minutes, check your pot. There should be ample curry. Give it all a final stir and check the chicken to make sure it is all cooked through. It should be by now, but you can never be too careful! Have some cooked rice handy and serve with some saag bhaji (another recipe!). This recipe is easy to scale up or down and if you have leftovers, you can eat this up to 4 days after you make it, at least."

Knead the dough for about 5 minutes by hand or pulse for about 15 seconds in the food processor; the dough should be smooth. With your hands, shape the dough into a cylinder or log about 2 inches thick and 6 inches long. With a sharp knife, cut the cylinder into 1/2-inch thick slices. The next step uses oil, so do not use your pastry cloth and rolling pin sleeve. Place each slice on a lightly oiled surface. Lightly oil the top of the slice and then roll out into a very thin circle about 6 or 7 inches in diameter. Papadams must be rolled extremely thin, maximum 1/16 inch. If the dough sticks to your rolling pin, gently pull it off. Dust the tops of each papadam with cayenne pepper. Using a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the papadams from the rolling surface, carefully place them on large baking sheets. The traditional method for preparing and frying papadams is described below; you can also bake them in a 300F oven for about 15 to 25 minutes, or until crisp and dry. The cooking time may vary beyond this range depending upon the thickness and moisture in the rolled dough. Cool them on a rack. To prepare the papadams in an authentic manner, don't bake them; first allow them to dry by leaving them in the sun for a few hours or by placing them in a very low oven (less than 200F) for 1 to 2 hours, turning occasionally. Dry the papadams until they are just slightly flexible and show no moisture; they should not brown or bake, however. At this point, the papadams may be stacked flat and stored in an airtight container until needed; they will keep for months if stored properly. When ready to serve, heat about 1/8 inch of oil in a large skillet; the oil should be hot, but not smoking; a drop of water flicked into the skillet should sizzle immediately. One at a time, drop the papadams into the hot oil. Turn the papadam when it begins to curl at the edges; it will quickly fry and become crisp. Remove it before it turns brown. Cool and drain the papadams on paper towels and eat them immediately."

Gulab Jamun,50mins,"milk, flour, powdered milk, self-rising flour, milk, ghee, sugar, water, rose water, saffron, cardamom powder, butter","To Make Ghee: Put the butter in a good saucepan and bring to a boil on medium heat. Then reduce to low. Now this is what will happen as the butter slowly simmers. Moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee. The white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden. A foam will rise to the surface, and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust. The butter will cook into a gold color as well, and it will have a slightly nutty smell. When the moisture is gone, the ghee is done. Decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast, or mixed with veggies or potatoes. If you've used salted butter, you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out, but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot. Making the Scented Syrup: Combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add rose water or essence. Traditional Method: Use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick. Use a non-stick pot if you have it. Boil the milk down over medium heat, while stirring,  until it forms a paste.  Add the flour and mix into a smooth paste. Oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls, place them onto a buttered plate and set aside. Powdered-Milk Method: Combine the warm milk and ghee together. Mix the powdered milk and flour together and sprinkle slowly into the wet mix to form a dough. Oil your hands and form uniform balls (about 24) and set aside on a buttered plate. This is the most delicate part of the operation. Gentle, low heat is a must. Use a wok or karai for best results, with the ghee about 2.5-3 inches in depth. Heat the ghee on low to 215 degrees. Slip in the balls, one by one. They will sink. No touching at this point. Gently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side. After about 5 minutes they will begin to float. You will notice them getting bigger. Now, use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning. The ghee will slowly get hotter as the balls cook. After about 20 minutes, the ghee will have risen in temperature to around 245 degrees and the balls should be nice and golden. Remove a ball and put it in the syrup. If it doesn't collapse after 3 minutes, remove the others and add to the syrup. If it does collapse, fry for another 5 minutes and try again. Let soak for 2 hours at least before serving. Serve room temperature or warmed up. Enjoy your gulab jamuns!"

Loretta Lynn Dump Cake,1hr 15mins,"chocolate cake mix, condensed milk,  caramel sauce, Cool Whip, Nestle Crunch bars","Try not to think about it. There's a reason people in this country are addicted to fatty foods that are bad for you, and this cake is going to appeal to all of those urges in you and more. Best cake in the world, remember? It's worth a shot.Preheat oven to 350. Follow the instructions on the cake mix box for baking. So, make your cake in the usual way, and when it's hot from the oven, use the cylindrical end of a large wooden spoon to poke holes in the cake. Oh, I should mention that I'd recommend the cake be baked in a 9x12 glass pan. And, the holes should be poked in neat columns and rows, let's say about an inch and a half apart. Maybe an inch. Maybe two inches. Maybe an inch and a half. Holes poked? Pour the can of condensed milk all over the cake. Pour the jar of caramel sauce all over the cake.Spread a liberal layer of Cool Whip all over the cake. While your cake was baking, you should have pounded the Nestlé Crunch bars into half-inch or less (or maybe a bit more) pieces. Now sprinkle those on top. DON'T EAT THE CAKE! If you must, if you really must, go ahead and have some, but it's not fair to judge your creation at this stage. It has not become the best cake in the world yet. Here, it's just a recipe for instant diabetic keelover. Put the cake in the refrigerator. Now you must leave that cake in there for as long as you can stand. Ideally, this means overnight. At least. But, if you're pressed for a choc fix, at least let it get nice and cold. But, again, it really is a ""this gets amazing after a day in the fridge"" recipe. And that's it. That is the very best cake in the world. Like so many precious artifacts, one would not expect to find such a powerful recipe in the hands of a kitchen simpleton such as myself, but I have come forth with the treasure. Now the world is forever changed. Or, if not the world, then your weekend, if you're smart (and want to be really, really popular with the rest of your household). Eat! Enjoy!"

Brazilian Brigadeiro,1hr,"sweetened condensed milk, margarine, cocoa powder, chocolate sprinkles","Cook over medium-low heat, stir vigorously the sweetened condensed milk, margarine and cocoa powder.

Take small amounts of the mixture with a teaspoon and make 1 ½ inch balls. Roll the balls over chocolate jimmies to decorate. Hint: Grease your hands with margarine to make the balls easily. If the balls don't hold the shape and flat down like coins, it means that you did not cook enough. Cook additional five minutes, take a small sample and dip it in a glass with cold water. If you cooked enough, this sample should hold the shape after cooling down in the water. The cheapest , low grade sweetened condensed milk is the best to make the brigadeiro because they have more starch on them, which helps the candy to hold the shape. In US, buy the sweet condensed milk from the Walmart brand  ""Great Value"", cook this brand for 20 minutes in medium heat stirring continuously and your brigadeiro is with the right consistency."

Fill a small pot of water with a 2-inch depth of water. Set over a low heat with the bowl of yellow candy melts on top. Stir until the yellow candy melts have melted and are smooth. Remove from the heat. Drop a small dollop (about 1/4 to 1/8 tsp) of the melted candy melt onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Using a small, offset spatula make a brushstroke motion over the dollop of candy melt to spread it out into a thin oval. Repeat this with all of the melted yellow candy melts – you may need to re-melt it in the bowl if it’s starting to set. Chill for 15-20 minutes until set. Place the green candy melts into a small, heatproof bowl. Fill a small pot of water with a 2-inch depth of water. Set over a low heat with the bowl of green candy melts on top. Stir until the green candy melts have melted and are smooth. Remove from the heat. Drop a small dollop of green candy melt onto a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Use a brushstroke motion (similar to before, but in a longer motion to make a longer stripe) to make one thin, long leaf.

In a large bowl combine the remaining crushed pineapple, remaining light rum, the reserved pineapple juice and remaining vanilla pudding mix, stirring until smooth and thickened. Fold in the thawed cool whip. Add the yellow food colouring and fold together to combine. Remove the cooled cake layers from the baking sheets. Use a 3-inch round cookie cutter to punch out 9 circles from each of the cake layers (so you have a total of eighteen 3-inch circles). Stack 3 cake circles on top of each other, sandwiching them together with 1 tbsp frosting between each layer. Repeat so you get six small 3-layer cakes. Use a serrated knife to carefully carve each small cake into a pineapple shape. Cover each small cake with frosting in an even layer. Cover with the chilled yellow candy melt ovals: start at the top of the cake, layering in rings going around the cake, allowing the candy melts to overlap slightly, until each cake is completely covered. Transfer the melted semisweet chocolate chips to a disposable piping bag. Snip off the very tip so you have a tiny opening. Pipe dots of dark chocolate randomly onto the yellow candy melts to represent the ‘eyes’ of the pineapple. Top each cake with one of the green candy melt crowns. Serve. Adding shredded coconut to your cakes will make it easier to trim into pineapple shapes – the coconut addition is not shown in the recipe video."

Decadent Krispies Bar,30mins,"cooking spray, light brown sugar, unsalted butter, ground cinnamon, miniature marshmallows, sliced almonds, dried apricot, Rice Krispies, white chocolate chips, canola oil, Grand Marnier","This bar comes together rather quickly. Begin by preparing a 9 by 9 inch pan with a good coating of cooking spray and set aside.  Also apply a bit of spray to your cooking spoon (preferably wooden). If your almonds are not already toasted, place them in a dry non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, routinely tossing the almonds around the pan. The almonds should add just a small amount of color and become slightly aromatic. To make the bars, begin by adding the butter and brown sugar together in a large sauce pan over medium to low heat. Stir while the both the butter and sugar melt for 2 minutes or so.  The result is smooth to the feel with a wooden spoon.  In addition, you should be able to move  it about the bottom of the pan with the spoon (sort of a blob). Add in the 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and stir. Add the miniature marshmallows and stir continuously helping the puffs to melt. Continue mixing until you have a pale brown mixture that is still rather loose. This is where things begin to move fast.  Once the marshmallows are fully melted and mixed with the sugar, add in the Rice Krispies, almonds and apricots. Stir quickly to get all of the ingredients incorporated. Turn the mixture out into the 9 by 9 inch pan, distributing as much as possible using your spoon. To level the bars in the pan, give your palms a quick shot of cooking spray and pat down. Place the bars in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set. Invert pan and give the pan a good whack to release the Krispies bar.  Slice into 12 pieces (4 by 3). Melt white chocolate chips in a double boiler over very low heat.  (If you do not have a double boiler, you can fashion one using a large bowl over a smaller saucepan. Just be certain the fit is tight and no steam is being released). Add the oil to the chocolate and stir while the the chips continue to melt.  If the chocolate begins to harden, this is sign the heat is too high and you should lower the flame or remove the top half of the double boiler from the bottom. Stir the Grand Marnier into the melted chocolate and use a spoon to stripe the bars on the diagonal allowing the melted chocolate to drip down the side.  If you are a big fan of white chocolate, you can skip the drizzling and just dunk the bars into the white chocolate and place on waxed paper to cool. (Timesaver tip:  If you want to speed things up a bit.  You can melt the chocolate after placing the bars in the pan and drizzle over the entire pan before cooling and cutting.  Not quite as pretty, but just as tasty)."

Brownies: Microwave butter and chocolate in large bowl on high, stirring every 20 seconds, until melted and smooth.  Whisk in sugar, then eggs, 1 at a time, then vanilla.  With a rubber spatula, stir in flour, cocoa powder and salt just until blended.  Stir in pecans.  Divide batter evenly amoun baking cups, or spread into baking pan.

Individual Baked Alaska,42mins,"bittersweet chocolate, heavy whipping cream, frozen raspberries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, salt, sponge cake, jelly-roll style, ice cream, egg white, granulated sugar, light corn syrup, water, confectioners' sugar","To make the chocolate sauce: chop the chocolate to a rough consistency. Heat the cream just to a scald, then pour over the chocolate. Do not stir. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, then stir with a whisk until smooth. Makes about 1 cup. To make the raspberry sauce: Puree the raspberries in a blender with the remaining ingredients. Strain through a fine mesh strainer to remove the seeds. Refrigerate until needed. Makes about 1 cup. To assemble the ice-cream bases: line a baking sheet with parchment. Using a 3"" round cookie cutter (or a glass) cut 6 circles out of the cake, and place them on the parchment. Place a scoop of ice cream in the center of each piece of cake, making sure you leave a small margin of cake visible all the way around. Place in the freezer until the meringue is ready. To prepare the meringue: combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy, 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then cook until the syrup reaches 230 degrees F. (thread stage) on a candy thermometer. Meanwhile, place the egg whites in the bowl of your mixer, and fit the whip attachment to your mixer. When the syrup reaches the thread stage, start whipping your egg whites on high speed. When the syrup reaches 245-250 degrees F. (firm-ball stage), lower the speed of the mixer to low, and very, very, VERY slowly start pouring the syrup in, in a slow, steady, thin stream until it is all used up. Immediately return the mixer to high speed and continue whipping until the meringue reaches a very stiff peaked consistency. Transfer the meringue to a piping bag fit with a plain tip. Remove the ice cream bases from the freezer. Now you are going to create a meringue""beehive"" around each scoop of ice cream. I find it easier to do this by removing one ice-cream scoop at a time to a cake turntable or a flat-work surface that I can spin around, like a small plate, pipe the meringue, then using a thin spatula, returning it carefully to the parchment. To pipe the meringue you need to start at the bottom edge of the cake, pipe a ring of meringue around the icecream so that it completely covers the cake edge. Then continue to pipe a line of meringue all around the scoop of ice cream, making sure you completely cover the ice cream, and that each line of meringue rests on top of the previous one. Finish with a small circle at the top. Repeat with remaining ice cream bases. Return them to the freezer until ready to serve. Just before service, decorate your plate: choose an oversize plate, like a dinner plate. Then using the sauces, paint or spoon or swirl them on to your hearts content. Any design you like. I like to just use squiggles, but anything goes at this point. Now- if you don't have a torch, you will need to turn your oven to broil. If you have a torch, get it ready. Remove the meringues from the freezer, and dust the top of each one with the confectioners sugar in a fine mesh strainer. If you are using a broiler, place the baking sheet under the broiler but leave the door open and watch. You will only need about 30-45 seconds, just enough time for the meringue to turn golden brown. Remove from the oven, place one in the center of each plate, and serve. If you are using a torch, turn your torch to a med-low setting, and carefully, gently use the torch to brown the outside of the meringues. Place one meringue on each plate, and serve. Notes: You can use any type of cake you want here- this recipe is more a method than anything. I've used chocolate chiffon as a base, I've used spongecake, poundcake, leftover slices of cupcakes! Anything, anyflavor, but it needs to be at least 1/4"" thick. You can also use any flavor ice-cream- experiment, go wild. Sorbet is great this way- I've done mango sorbet, and lime sorbet- they taste terrific. Experiment, have fun, and don't be intimidated by this dessert. It's fun, and it's easy, and your friends and relatives will""oooohhhh! ""and""ahhhhh! ""you to death!"

Chocolate Cookarolis,25mins,"refrigerated sugar cookie dough, bittersweet chocolate chips, all-purpose flour, baking powder, kosher salt, shortening, milk, egg, water, vegetable oil, confectioners' sugar","MAKE THE COOKAROLIS: Cut cookie dough in half lengthwise and place onto a long sheet of plastic wrap (about 2 feet). Place one half of the dough into the center, then place another sheet of plastic wrap loosely over top. Roll out cookie dough into a 4"" wide strip 1/4"" thick. Lift off top sheet of plastic wrap and discard. Place 3-4 chocolate morsels in a group onto the bottom of cookie strip 1/2"" apart.

Place cookarolis onto the dough 1/4"" apart on the bottom half of the dough. Brush the edges of half of the dough lightly with the egg wash (remember egg wash sticks to dough, but not itself). Fold top part of dough over and separate (using a pizza cutter works well) and then gently seal the edges together with the tines of a fork, dipping the tines into some flour as needed. Repeat with second ball of dough. Place on cookie sheet and refridgerate for a minimum of 30 minutes.

(NOTE:  I tried to put in just additional powdered sugar to thicken the glaze, but it wouldn't accept it without an amount.  I'm guessing on the additional amount that I actually used.  I think it was about an additional cup of powdered sugar to thicken the glaze to the consistency that I wanted.  Of course, you can use the amount necessary to thicken to the consistency that you like)."

Gooey Butter Cake,50mins,"butter, yellow cake mix, eggs, cream cheese, pure vanilla extract, confectioners' sugar","Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease (or spray with Pam) one deep 9x13 rectangular cake pan. I would suggest a 4 in deep pan, as the cake rises when it is cooking, but a oven-safe disposable coffee cake pan from the grocery store would work fine too. Melt butter. I do this by heating the the microwave on low power for 30 seconds. Empty cake mix into a large bowl. Stir melted butter, along with ONE egg, into the cake mix. PRESS mixture into pan. Mixture will have the consistency of sticky dough. Using a spatula works for me, but pressing with clean fingers will do the trick as well. In a large bowl, mix cream cheese, almond or vanilla extract, confectioners sugar and the remaining two eggs. Beat for three minutes with an electric mixer set on medium high speed, or until smooth with NO lumps. Pour evenly over top of the cake mixture in the pan. Use a spatula to spread. Place a large cookie sheet on the rack below the cake. Sometimes when you use a cake pan with less depth, the cake bubbles and spills over. The cookie sheet will spare your oven! Bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes until golden brown on top. Cooking time is estimated, you will really have to watch it here! I always take the cake out when it turns a darkish golden brown. Note that there will be a paper thin sugar ""crust"" that will form while the cake is baking. It the top layer of sugar hardening, and this is what will turn golden brown. It adds great texture! Allow cake to cool COMPLETELY. This is very important, as the cake will not cut easily until it is completely cool. You will notice that the cake has sunken and set. This is normal. Refrigeration is optional. I personally like it at room temperature. Dust the top with confectioners’ sugar. Cut cake into bars and serve with or without utensils, but make sure you have plenty of napkins, because this treat will have you licking your fingers!  (Cake should be gooey underneath the sugar ""crust"", so don't over bake!)."

Fudgy & Salty Peanut Butter Brownies,1hr 10mins,"cocoa powder, fine sea salt, sugar, pure vanilla extract, eggs, all-purpose flour, semi-sweet chocolate chips, creamy peanut butter, unsalted butter, powdered sugar, fine sea salt, milk, pure vanilla extract, salted peanuts, semi-sweet chocolate chips, unsalted butter","Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F. For your brownie batter: Melt your butter in a medium (or large) heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. While the butter is melting, whisk the cocoa powder, sea salt and sugar in a separate bowl. (The sugar and salt will work as abrasive agents to get any lumps out of the cocoa.) Whisk the cocoa/sugar/salt combo into the melted butter until the sugar has dissolved fully. The mixture should look like fudge and pull away from the bowl into a ball. Take off the stove and set the pan on a dishtowel on your counter. Allow the fudgy mixture to cool down until it's warm, but not hot anymore. While that is cooling, line the bottom and sides of your 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper or foil. You want to leave about 4 inches of overhang on the 2 opposite sides. These serve as your handles to remove the brownies from the pan in 1 piece, so make sure that there is enough of the overhang for you to have a solid grip. Grease the parchment or foil well. Stir in the vanilla into the cooled fudge mixture to loosen it up. Add the eggs into the mixture 1 at a time, adding the second egg after the first egg is fully incorporated. The batter should look shiny and well blended. Add in your flour and stir it until it's fully incorporated. Once it looks fully blended, beat the batter vigorously for at least 45 strokes. This'll not only get out any pent up stress, but it will make the brownies chewy. Fold in your chocolate chips. Spread the very thick and fudgy brownie batter evenly in the lined pan with an offset spatula or your greased hands. Pop the brownies in the oven and bake until they get a nice crust and your house smells like brownies, 30 to 35 minutes. Let them cool completely on a rack or a dishtowel on your counter. While the brownies are cooling make the buttercream and ganache. For the buttercream: Mix your peanut butter and butter together in a stand mixer until they are totally blended. Turn your mixer down and slowly add your powdered sugar and fine sea salt. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Turn your mixer back to medium, add your milk and vanilla and keep mixing until it's fully blended. Dollop the peanut butter buttercream in heaping spoonfuls on top of the cooled brownies. Evenly spread it with the back of a butter knife the over the surface. Scatter the peanuts evenly over the buttercream, pressing into the buttercream so that the ganache has something to hold on to and the peanuts are all covered. For the ganache: Melt the chocolate chips and butter together in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Allow the ganache to cool down slightly for 10 minutes or so, then pour it evenly over the peanut butter buttercream layer. Smooth the ganache out with the back of a butter knife, making sure to cover the buttercream and peanuts completely. Chill the brownies in the refrigerator until the toppings are set, 1 1/2 hours or so. Remove these delicious guys from the refrigerator. Lift up the ends of the foil liner and place the Fudgy Salty Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownies on a cutting board. Cut into squares. Enjoy!"

Remove the cake from the oven and let cool for 20 minutes in the pan. Loosen the edges of the cake with a small spatula or butter knife, flip the cake out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely. In a small bowl, stir together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder and milk until smooth. Spoon over the top of the cooled cake, letting it drip down the sides of the cake.
